Cloud Services:

KwikEats is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to leverage the scalability, 

reliability, and security of the cloud. The key AWS services utilized in this project 

include:

AWS Elastic Beanstalk: The application is deployed and hosted on AWS Elastic 

Beanstalk, a fully managed service that handles the deployment, scaling, and monitoring 

of the web application. Elastic Beanstalk simplifies the process of provisioning and 

managing the underlying infrastructure, allowing the development team to focus on 

building the application.

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS): The application's database is 

hosted on Amazon RDS, a managed database service that supports various database 

engines, including MySQL. Amazon RDS handles database administration tasks, such as 

software patching, automatic backups, and failover, ensuring the reliability and 

availability of the application's data.

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC): The application and database 

components are deployed within a private Amazon VPC, which provides a secure and 

isolated network environment. This ensures that the application's data and resources are 

protected from external access, enhancing the overall security of the system.

Methodologies Used:

The development of KwikEats follows an Agile software development methodology, 

specifically the Scrum framework. Scrum promotes iterative and incremental 

development, with a focus on collaboration, continuous improvement, and delivering 

value to the customer.

Scrum Workflow: The development team follows the Scrum workflow, which includes 

Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Reviews, and Sprint Retrospectives. This 

approach allows the team to adapt to changing requirements, prioritize features, and 

continuously improve the application.
